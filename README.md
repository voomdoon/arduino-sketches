# Arduino-sketches

Collection of simple Arduino sketches.

## How to use

* Have related wiring.
* Check and maybe update the configuration section regarding pin numbers. 

## Roadmap

* Add wringing diagrams.
* Add wiring photos.

## Disclaimer

* no warranty for any negative impact
* double check your wiring before uploading the program
  * verify all pins are connected as specified at the configuration section
  * verify the correct resistors are used to avoid overvoltage
* maybe clear the program using [no-op](no-op) before changing the wiring
